# CW 29
## introducing class TreeSetStandard implementing telran.util.SortedSet
## running tests comparing performance of TreeSetStndard comprising of the stndard java.util.TreeSet and telran.util.TreeSet
### explanation why telran.util.TreeSet doesn't work at adding 1000000 numbers in sorted order
## method balance in telran.util.TreeSet
## testing method balance



# HW 29
## Writing method getBigArrayHW in the class SortedSetTest
### allows creating array for creating a balanced TreeSet with no addition "balance" method call
## Test of the method getBigArrayHW - balanceTestHW 
### uses the method getBigArrayHW
### creates and fills TreeSet from the created array
### checks that the created TreeSet is a balanced with no addition balance method call
